# WhiskyLog
A easy program written to log teh whiskyes you have tasted or have in your collection.

It works by running the command python3 whisky_db.py in your terminal
you will then be promtet with an empty promt, by typing an random charecter and pressing enter you will be shown the commands avalible. The commands are as followed: add (to add a whisky), show (to show the whiskies you have added), delete (to delete an entery in the log. This is not working atm), to exit the program just press enter.

When you type add you will be promted to type in the brand and name of the whisky, then the abv, country of origin, what type of whisky (Singel malt, blend etc), and last your overall rating of the whisky (iÂ´ve rated from 1-10, but you choose)
